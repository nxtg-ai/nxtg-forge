# ⚠️ EARLY ALPHA - NEEDS CONTRIBUTORS -- BE CAREFUL ⚠️

# NXTG-Forge

**Make Claude Smarter**

```bash
# Install from source (PyPI coming soon)
git clone https://github.com/nxtg-ai/nxtg-forge.git
cd nxtg-forge
pip install -e .

# Go to your project and initialize
cd ~/my-project
forge init
```

That's it. Now use Claude Code with `/feature`, `/status`, and intelligent agent orchestration.

> **Note**: Package not yet published to PyPI. Install from source for now. PyPI publication coming soon.

NXTG-Forge enhances Claude Code with intelligent multi-agent coordination, memory persistence, and automated workflows. You don't configure it—it learns from your project.

## What Just Happened?

Claude can now:
- **Break complex tasks into steps** automatically
- **Handle larger refactorings** intelligently across multiple files
- **Remember context** across interrupted sessions
- **Coordinate work** that spans architecture, implementation, and testing

You don't configure any of this. It just works.

## Example

**Without nxtg-forge:**

```
You: "Add OAuth2 authentication"

Claude: "I'll help you add OAuth2. Where should I create the auth module?"
You: "In src/auth/"
Claude: "What providers do you want?"
You: "Google and GitHub"
Claude: [Implements one file]
You: "Now add the database models"
Claude: [Implements models]
You: "Can you add tests?"
... (5+ back-and-forth exchanges)
```

**With nxtg-forge:**

```
You: "Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub"

Claude: "I'll implement OAuth2 authentication for you.

Creating:
  • User model with secure password hashing
  • OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub)
  • Login/logout endpoints
  • JWT token generation and validation
  • Session management with Redis
  • Database migrations
  • 24 unit tests
  • Integration tests for auth flows
  • API documentation

Starting with the user model..."

[Delivers complete, tested authentication system]
```

**One request. Complete implementation.**

## Installation

### Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Install the package
pip install nxtg-forge  # (or install from source - see below)

# 2. Go to your project
cd ~/my-project

# 3. Initialize
forge init
```

That's it. Now `claude` in your project directory and use slash commands like `/feature` and `/status`.

### From Source (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nxtg-ai/nxtg-forge.git
cd nxtg-forge

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Go to your project and initialize
cd ~/my-project
forge init
```

> **PyPI Publication Status**: Package is not yet published to PyPI. For now, install from source using the method above. We're preparing for PyPI publication - stay tuned!

### What `forge init` Does

1. Copies `.claude/` directory with:
   - Slash commands (`/init`, `/feature`, `/status`, etc.)
   - Agent capabilities (architecture, backend, CLI, etc.)
   - Lifecycle hooks (pre-commit, post-feature, etc.)
   - Workflow automation (TDD cycle, refactor bot, etc.)
   - Prompt templates

2. Creates `.claude/forge/config.yml` with sensible defaults

3. Ready to use - no configuration needed

### Verify Installation

```bash
forge --version
# nxtg-forge 1.0.0

forge --help
# Shows all available commands including 'init'
```

## Usage

Just use Claude Code like you always have:

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

Claude will automatically use nxtg-forge when it helps. You'll notice:
- **Complex tasks** get handled in one go instead of many back-and-forth exchanges
- **Interrupted work** can be resumed with `/resume`
- **Quality** is consistently higher (tests, docs, error handling included)

### When Does It Activate?

Nxtg-forge activates automatically for:
- **Feature development** ("Add payment processing")
- **Cross-file refactoring** ("Extract all logging to a service")
- **Complex setup** ("Create a REST API with auth")
- **Multi-step tasks** ("Implement and test user registration")

For simple tasks (documentation, quick fixes), Claude uses standard behavior.

## Usage

### Slash Commands (Claude Code)

```bash
/status              # Show project status
/feature "name"      # Add new feature

/restore             # Restore from checkpoint
/gap-analysis        # Analyze project gaps
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
forge status                    # Show project status
forge checkpoint "description"  # Create state checkpoint
forge restore [checkpoint-id]   # Restore from checkpoint
forge mcp detect --configure    # Auto-detect and configure MCP servers
forge gap-analysis              # Run gap analysis
forge health                    # Calculate project health score
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Development setup
make dev-install    # Install development dependencies

# Code quality
make test           # Run test suite
make lint           # Run linter
make format         # Format code
make quality        # Run all quality checks

# Docker
make docker-build   # Build Docker image
make docker-up      # Start services
make docker-down    # Stop services
```

## Agent System

NXTG-Forge uses specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of development:

- 🏗️ **Lead Architect** - System architecture and design decisions
- ⚙️ **Backend Master** - API implementation and business logic
- 💻 **CLI Artisan** - Command-line interface development
- 🚢 **Platform Builder** - Infrastructure and deployment
- 🔗 **Integration Specialist** - External APIs and services
- ✅ **QA Sentinel** - Testing and quality assurance

## Lifecycle Hooks

NXTG-Forge includes automated hooks that run during Claude Code workflows:

- **pre-task.sh** - Initializes state, validates structure before tasks
- **post-task.sh** - Runs tests, checks quality, suggests next steps
- **on-error.sh** - Analyzes errors, provides contextual suggestions
- **on-file-change.sh** - Auto-formats code, validates syntax
- **state-sync.sh** - Manages backups, checkpoints, and project health

Hooks automatically:

- Create `state.json` from template on first use
- Format Python code with Black
- Validate JSON/YAML syntax
- Track project statistics and health scores
- Create automatic backups (last 10 retained)
- Provide intelligent error recovery suggestions

See [`.claude/hooks/README.md`](.claude/hooks/README.md) for complete documentation.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
