# Gap Analysis Report

> Generated by NXTG-Forge on 2025-01-04 16:50:00 UTC

## Executive Summary

- **Critical Issues:** 1
- **High Priority:** 3
- **Medium Priority:** 4
- **Low Priority:** 2

**Total Gaps:** 10

⚠️  **Status:** NEEDS ATTENTION - Address high-priority issues

## Testing

### 🔴 No test directory found

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Priority:** P1

**Recommendation:**
Create test directory and add tests. Add comprehensive unit tests with pytest framework to achieve target coverage of 85%.

---

### 🟠 Unit test coverage is 0% (target: 85%)

**Severity:** HIGH
**Priority:** P1

**Recommendation:**
Add unit tests to increase coverage. Focus on testing core modules: spec_generator, file_generator, mcp_detector, gap_analyzer, state_manager.

---

### 🟡 Integration test coverage is 0% (target: 70%)

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Priority:** P2

**Recommendation:**
Add integration tests for key workflows. Test /init --new and /init --upgrade flows end-to-end.

---

### 🟡 No E2E tests found

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Priority:** P2

**Recommendation:**
Add E2E tests for critical user journeys. Test complete project generation and deployment workflows.

---

## Documentation

### 🟡 Missing documentation: ARCHITECTURE.md, API.md, DEPLOYMENT.md

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Priority:** P2

**Recommendation:**
Create missing documentation files. Document system architecture, API endpoints, and deployment procedures.

---

## Code Quality

### 🟡 No linter configuration found

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Priority:** P2

**Recommendation:**
Configure linter (ruff for Python, eslint for JS). Add .ruff.toml with project-specific rules.

---

### 🟢 No code formatter configured

**Severity:** LOW
**Priority:** P3

**Recommendation:**
Configure code formatter (black for Python, prettier for JS). Add to pre-commit hooks.

---

## Infrastructure

### 🟠 No Dockerfile found

**Severity:** HIGH
**Priority:** P1

**Recommendation:**
Create Dockerfile for containerization. Use multi-stage builds for optimal image size.

---

### 🟠 No CI/CD pipeline configured

**Severity:** HIGH
**Priority:** P1

**Recommendation:**
Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions or similar. Include lint, test, build, and deploy stages.

---

### 🟢 Monitoring and observability not verified

**Severity:** LOW
**Priority:** P3

**Recommendation:**
Configure logging, metrics, and alerting. Consider Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, structured logging with JSON format.

---

## Recommended Action Plan

1. No test directory found
2. Unit test coverage is 0% (target: 85%)
3. No Dockerfile found
4. No CI/CD pipeline configured
5. Integration test coverage is 0% (target: 70%)
6. No E2E tests found
7. Missing documentation: ARCHITECTURE.md, API.md, DEPLOYMENT.md
8. No linter configuration found
9. No code formatter configured
10. Monitoring and observability not verified

   - Aim for 85% coverage target

3. **Add Infrastructure** (Priority: High)
   - Create Dockerfile using template
   - Set up docker-compose.yml
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline

4. **Documentation** (Priority: Medium)

   - Create API documentation
   - Add deployment guide
   - Update main README.md

5. **Code Quality Tools** (Priority: Medium)
   - Configure ruff linter
   - Set up black formatter
   - Add pre-commit hooks
   - Run initial code quality scan

6. **End-to-End Testing** (Priority: Medium)
   - Test `/init --new` workflow
   - Test `/init --upgrade` workflow
   - Validate template generation
   - Verify MCP auto-configuration
